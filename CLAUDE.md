# Web Terminal — Claude Code Instructions

## Project Overview
Browser-based terminal manager with multi-server cluster support, WebSocket sessions, and PWA. Runs on Node.js + Express + node-pty.

## Pre-Commit Gates (MANDATORY)

Before EVERY commit, you MUST complete these checks in order:

### 1. Security Review
- Review all changed files for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Check for: command injection, XSS, auth bypass, path traversal, secret exposure
- Verify no secrets (passwords, tokens, API keys) are committed
- Verify auth middleware covers all new routes
- Verify Bearer token endpoints validate tokens properly
- Check that user input is sanitized before use in shell commands, HTML, or file paths

### 2. Run Tests
```bash
cd C:/dev/web-terminal
npx playwright test
```
- ALL tests must pass before committing
- If tests fail, fix the issue first
- If new functionality was added, verify relevant test coverage exists

### 3. Syntax Check
```bash
node -c server.js
```

### 4. Update README.md
If new user-facing features were added, update `README.md`:
- Add to the Features list
- Add configuration docs for new settings
- Update the Architecture table if new files were created
- Keep the Multi-Server Cluster and PWA sections current

## Architecture
- `server.js` — Express server, WebSocket, session management, auth, cluster proxy
- `app.html` — Unified single-page app (terminal + session management + settings)
- `terminal.html` — Legacy terminal-only page (served at /s/:id)
- `lobby.html` — Legacy lobby page (served at /lobby)
- `sw.js` — Service worker for PWA caching
- `tests/security.spec.js` — Auth, session CRUD, XSS, config security tests
- `tests/cluster.spec.js` — Token auth, cluster API, proxy security tests

## Auth System
- Cookie-based session auth (primary, for browser users)
- Bearer token auth (for cluster inter-server communication)
- Tokens stored in `api-tokens.json` (gitignored)
- Cluster remote tokens stored in `cluster-tokens.json` (gitignored)
- Each server in cluster has independent credentials

## Key Security Rules
- Never expose passwords in API responses (always mask as `***`)
- API tokens have 90-day expiry
- Rate limiting on login attempts
- All new API routes MUST be behind auth middleware
- WebSocket auth supports both cookie and query-string token
- Cluster proxy MUST validate stored token exists before forwarding
- Never pass unsanitized user input to `term.write()`, `execFile()`, or HTML

## Test Config
- Tests run on port 17681 with credentials: testuser / testpass:colon
- Uses Playwright for both API and browser tests
- Test config in `playwright.config.js`
